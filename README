I added some features, supported by a GUI which emulates option and check controls. These controls allow to select which earthquakes are visible regarding age (from "Past day" to "Past month"), magnitude (all visible, Top 10 strongest, Top 100 strongest), and also working with the following preferences: "Show cities" (show/hide cities on the map), "Highlight quakes" (add/remove an X for recent quakes), "Ocean threat lines" (show/hide lines for an ocean quake affecting cities within its threat circle), "Show threat circle" (show/hide a circle indicating the threat area affected by the quake selected, which is only valid for small threat radius*), and "Show coordinates" (show/hide geographic coordinates for any position pointed by the mouse cursor).

(*) Drawing a good approximation of the threat area for any radius is not straightforward at all!!! I use the bisection method (analogous to binary search) to calculate the diameter in pixels for the circle, but I realized the real shape is not a circle. I do not know how a threat area should look, but I figured out some way to implement this, by using numerical methods. I do not have enough time to solve it, since the deadline is tomorrow, but it is a challenge that I will be confronting in the next days... At the end, for relatively small areas, the shape should look similar to a circle as I noticed by the getDistance method behavior (see figure 2).
